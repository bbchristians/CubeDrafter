General
---------------
Make these in some kind of organization software instead of a text file
Pretend I'm actually working on a degree that heavily emphasizes OO design
Learn how to make an executable for python that doesn't make me look like an idiot



Data
---------------
Add a unique ID (From magic API), color, CMC, (types? if not in desc) and desc to locally saved card data
  Unique ID for AI recognition of cards
    Upload via unique ID?
  Color, CMC, types for AI decision making
  Desc for GUI Display and AI decision parsing
Add a means of loading all images for a pool (Don't do on initial web query, but have function to do it later)
Actual non-csv DBs?


Machine Learning
---------------
Create object for saving a Humans' draft picks
  Attend enough Linear Algebra classes that I can somewhat understand articles detailing how to efficiently transform this information into relevant data
  But first do it poorly
Create a means of parsing card description data for keywords to find associations and base other picks on
Create a way to rewatch an AI's picks (Mostly to study algorithms' effectiveness)
  Plain Text / GUI?
Create a way for AI to report why it's making the decisions it is
Investigate remote web scouring for limited set ratings (Does Draftsim have info?)


GUI
---------------
Scenes
  Draft Scene
    Card pool display
      Sorting (color, CMC, drag/drop? (probably not))
  Cube Scene
    Make a way to change
  Menu Scene?
  Deck Build Scene?
  AI draft review?
  
  
Stretch
